Hello

Thanks for taking a look at my website. I'm a designer based in Cambridge, MA, who brings a history of engineering to a creative projects. I currently work at the MIT Design Lab as a technologist, exploring global challenges with an amazing team. 

I care about bringing emerging tech to solve big problems, beautifully.

Over the years I've developed NEW ULTRALIGHT MATERIALS, created a MARKETING PIPELINE, worked on the user experience for a novel class of 3D PRINTING, developed parametric TANGIBLE USER INTERFACES for Cambridge and Beijing and brought auxetic structures to NEXT GENERATION ATHLETIC WEAR.
