Summary: 'Over the course of several years I worked with a partner to build a startup
  designing, marketing and selling aerogels - nano-materials with extreme properties.
  After developing and validating the core product process, I oversaw operations and
  coordinated a growing team.  Operations included designing and overseeing manufacturing
  lines, inventory, e-commerce, outreach, sales and customer service - most aspect
  of a growing startup.

New materials have the potential to transform society. From advanced alloys to composites to engineered concretes, every step forward in material science has unlocked design opportunities and innovations in form and function in the built world. 

One specific need is for materials that combine the qualities of high strength with low weight. Application areas are numerous but could be particularly transformative for the aerospace, transportation and construction industries.

Aerogels - a class of ultralight, nano-porous materials - occupy several extremes on the spectrum of desirable properties. The structure of aerogels are fascinating - formed as wet gels, long chains of primary nanoparticles are combined in wet solution, then carefully dried in a sensitive, high pressure process known as supercritical extraction. When created with silicon dioxide, aerogels exhibits the same optical properties that create the blue of the sky, or the sunset. 

Prior to working on Aerogel Technologies, pristine samples of bulk aerogel were difficult and expensive to come by - mainly shards from a manufacturing plant created to supply the material for a  NASA probe. Through formulation iteration, we created a production plant and R&d facility producing pristine aerogels in a range of formulas for industry, research and the general public. Our efforts had the effect of lowering the price of aerogels by a factor of 100 and led to a new niche industry that carries on today.
